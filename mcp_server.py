def get_image_info() -> dict:
    """
    Retrieve system information from the Windows memory image, including
    OS version, architecture, and kernel details.

    Use this tool when the user asks about:
    - What operating system or Windows version the memory image is from
    - System architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit)
    - Kernel or NT build information
    - General information about the captured machine
    - When to start analysis (call this first to warm up the session)

    Returns a dict with:
    - "plugin": "info"
    - "results": dict of key-value pairs, where each key is a system variable
      name (str) and each value is the corresponding system value (str).
      Typical keys include: "Kernel Base", "DTB", "Is64Bit", "IsPAE",
      "NTBuildLab", "NTBuildLabEx", "NtMajorVersion", "NtMinorVersion", etc.

    Forensic context:
    - Call this tool first in any analysis session; it initializes internal
      configuration and caches it, making all subsequent plugin calls faster
    - Use the OS version to determine which artifacts and behaviors are expected
      (e.g., Windows 7 vs Windows 10 have different default processes)
    - The "Is64Bit" value determines whether WoW64 fields from get_processes
      or scan_processes are meaningful

def get_processes() -> dict:
    """
    Run the pslist plugin to enumerate processes from the Windows memory image
    by walking the active process linked list (EPROCESS doubly-linked list).

    Use this tool when the user asks about:
    - Running processes or active programs
    - Process list or what applications were open at the time of capture
    - A specific process by name or PID
    - Process counts, thread counts, or handle counts
    - Process creation or exit times

    Returns a dict with:
    - "plugin": "pslist"
    - "results": list of dicts, each containing:
        "PID": process ID (int),
        "PPID": parent process ID (int),
        "ImageFileName": process name (str),
        "Offset(V)": virtual offset of EPROCESS (str, hex),

        "CreateTime": process creation timestamp (str),
        "ExitTime": process exit timestamp (str or None)

    Forensic context:
    - Compare with scan_processes results to detect hidden or unlinked processes;
      a process found by scan_processes but missing from get_processes suggests
      DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation) or rootkit activity
    - Use PID values from this output as context when investigating specific
      processes with future tools (e.g., cmdline, dlllist, handles)
    - Unusual parent-child relationships (e.g., svchost.exe not parented by
      services.exe, or cmd.exe spawned by a browser) may indicate process
      injection, lateral movement, or malware execution
    - Use get_process_tree for a hierarchical view of the same data

def scan_processes() -> dict:
    """
    Run the psscan plugin to find processes by scanning for pool tags in
    physical memory, independent of the OS-maintained process list.

    Use this tool when the user asks about:
    - Hidden, terminated, or unlinked processes
    - Rootkit detection or anti-forensics analysis
    - Processes that may have been removed from the active process list
    - A more thorough or exhaustive process scan
    - DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation) detection

        "CreateTime": process creation timestamp (str),
        "ExitTime": process exit timestamp (str or None)

    Forensic context:
    - Compare this result set against get_processes output: any process present
      here but absent from get_processes was unlinked from the active process
      list, which is a strong indicator of rootkit or DKOM activity
    - Terminated processes (with ExitTime set) appear here but not in
      get_processes, which is normal — focus on processes without ExitTime
      that are missing from get_processes
    - Pool tag scanning operates on physical memory and does not rely on OS
      data structures, making it resistant to kernel-level manipulation
    - Use get_process_tree to visualize parent-child relationships for any
      suspicious PIDs discovered through this scan

def get_process_tree() -> dict:

    Run the pstree plugin to display processes in a parent-child hierarchy
    with depth information, showing how processes were spawned.

    Use this tool when the user asks about:
    - Process tree or process hierarchy
    - Parent-child process relationships
    - Which process spawned which other process
    - Process lineage or ancestry of a specific process
    - Visual or structural overview of running processes

        "depth": nesting depth in the tree (int, 0 = root process)

    Forensic context:
    - The "depth" field encodes the tree structure: depth 0 processes are root
      nodes (System, smss.exe), and each increment represents one level of
      parent-child nesting
    - Suspicious patterns include: svchost.exe not under services.exe,
      cmd.exe or powershell.exe spawned by browser or Office processes,
      or deeply nested process chains used to evade detection
    - Compare with scan_processes to check whether any parent PIDs reference
      processes that have been unlinked or terminated (broken ancestry)
    - Use get_processes for a flat list when tree structure is not needed
